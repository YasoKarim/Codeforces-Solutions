## Codeforces-Solutions
This is a collection of my solved problems for codeforces <br />
I hope it helps for your Coding training =D <br />

## **Important Notes** <br />
* You need to study ASCII code very well, it will help you to find solutions. <br />
* You need to study math. <br />
* You need to know the syntax of the language you are using. (C++ preferred as it's execution time is less than most programming languages and contains a great STL) <br />
Here is a link to download book that explains C++ in an efficient way [PDF BOOK DOWNLOAD](http://powerunit-ju.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Daniel-Y-Liang-et-al.-Introduction-to-Programming-with-C-Pearson-2014.pdf) <br />
* You **have** to study **strings**, it is a **very important** topic. <br />
##**Useful Links for CPP Syntax and sites for Problem solving** <br />
#**Problems are rated by letters such as A are the easiest and so on, it is better to solve on a specific topic till you handle it and jump to next one**
* [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp) as a beginner use this link to learn c++ <br />
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) It is a good place to learn C++ (beginner) and there are contests available to participate in <br />
* [Javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-tutorial) <br />
* [CodeCrackers](https://codescracker.com/cpp/program/cpp-program-reverse-array.htm#:~:text=To%20reverse%20an%20array%20in%20C%2B%2B%20programming%2C%20you,second%20last%20index%20to%20second%20and%20so%20on) Good collection of programs <br />

* As a beginner solving problems in this site as they are rated from easiest to the hardest [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/practice?end_rating=999&group=all&hints=0&itm_campaign=practice&itm_medium=navmenu&limit=20&page=0&search=&sort_by=difficulty_rating&sort_order=asc&start_rating=0&tags=&topic=&video_editorial=0&wa_enabled=0) <br />
* You can shift also to this site [atcoder](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/#/table/) <br />
* You can follow this Plan with assuit sheets [Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12XlGl2Nae1NXRDNet_bGQ2HM2O3kq-9FS0Jm2pDwFyg/edit#gid=1683044666) and link to the
sheets on codeforces [Assuit Sheets](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests) <br />
##VERY IMPORTANT NOTE FORCUS ON ONE PLAN ONLY DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY DIFFERENT PATHS

## Always remember <br />
> The expert in anything was once a beginner. <br />
Good Luck !
