## Codeforces-Solutions
This is a collection of my solved problems for codeforces <br />
I hope it helps for your Coding training =D <br />

## **Important Notes** <br />
* You need to study ASCII code very well, it will help you to find solutions. <br />
* You need to study math. <br />
* You need to know the syntax of the language you are using. (C++ preferred as it's execution time is less than most programming languages) <br />
* You **have** to study strings, it is a **very important** topic. <br />
Always remember <br />
> The expert in anything was once a beginner. <br />
Keep Going!
